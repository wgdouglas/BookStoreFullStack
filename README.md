# Java Full Stack Application with React & Spring Boot - Book Store Project

The goal of this project is to figure out how to learn how to set-up 
enterprise level application and how to do test driven development and 
how to write clean code and What is the ideal workflow for developing 
full stack application.

### Goals to learn
1. [ ] Master everything required to build an end to end Enterprise Java Application with react
2. [ ] How to write unit testcases for Java and React
3. [ ] Integration testing with Java spring boot - With H2 InMemory database
4. [ ] How to write unit testcases for data access layer with H2
5. [ ] How to deploy Java and react application on heroku
6. [ ] Continuous integration and continuous deployment
7. [ ] Fully Automate development process with Travis CI
8. [ ] Setup of Redux and testing
9. [ ] How to Setup Swagger for documentation
10. [ ] How to maintain data migration script with flyway
11. [ ] How to setup JWT with spring boot
12. [ ] How to maintain JWT in react

### Key points of this project 
* How to setup actual enterprise level workflow with CI/CD using Travis CI and deploy both application to Heroku and locally we will connect spring boot application with H2 database and on prod we will connect with Postrgresql.
* How to deploy both frontend and backend on server.
* How to maintain different environment like DEV,PROD.
* How to maintain database migration script with flyway
* How to document rest api with swagger.
* How to write Unit and Integration testcases for spring boot application.
* How to write Unit testcases for Redux side.
* How to write Unite testcases for React.
* How to secure application with JWT
* Learn How to setup Jwt based authentication with spring boot and react


The most important thing that we will learn during this project would 
be test driven development with Spring boot and React & redux and while 
developing application we will learn best practice for react side and backend side.
